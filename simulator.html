        <h2>Priority Preemptive</h2>
        <p>
          Priority preemptive scheduling is a scheduling algorithm where each
          process is assigned a priority. The scheduler selects the process with
          the highest priority for execution. If a higher priority process
          arrives, the currently running process may be preempted and placed
          back in the ready queue. In the virtual lab, you can simulate multiple
          processes arriving at different priorities and observe how the
          scheduler switches between them based on their priorities.

        <h2>Reader-Writer Solution</h2>
        <p>
          The reader-writer problem is a synchronization problem where multiple
          readers can read a shared resource simultaneously, but only one writer
          can modify the resource, and while a writer is writing, no reader can
          access the resource. In the virtual lab, you can create multiple
          reader and writer processes and demonstrate how they interact with the
          shared resource, ensuring that readers can access it concurrently
          while preventing writers from writing simultaneously.

        <h2>First-Come-First-Serve Disk Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) is a disk scheduling algorithm where the
          requests are processed in the order they arrive. The head of the disk
          moves in a direction, servicing all requests until it reaches the end
          and then moves back. It has high waiting time for requests that arrive
          later in the queue.

        <h2>Least Recently Used (LRU) Page Replacement</h2>
        <p>
          LRU page replacement is a page replacement algorithm that replaces the
          least recently used page when a new page needs to be brought into
          memory. It's based on the principle that pages that have been used
          least recently are the best candidates for replacement. In the virtual
          lab, you can simulate a memory cache with limited space and multiple
          pages competing for space. Demonstrate how the LRU algorithm decides
          which page to evict when the cache is full and a new page needs to be
          loaded.
